<h1 id="multithreading-in-cray-openshmemx">Multithreading in Cray OpenSHMEMX</h1>
<pre><code>This section specifies the interaction between the OpenSHMEM interfaces
and user threads. It also describes the routines that can be used for
initializing and querying the thread environment. There are four levels
of threading defined by the OpenSHMEM specification.

SHMEM_THREAD_SINGLE
    The OpenSHMEM program must not be multithreaded.

SHMEM_THREAD_FUNNELED
    The OpenSHMEM program may be multithreaded. However, the program must
    ensure that only the main thread invokes the OpenSHMEM interfaces. The
    main thread is the thread that invokes either shmem_init or
    shmem_init_thread.

SHMEM_THREAD_SERIALIZED
    The OpenSHMEM program may be multithreaded. However, the program must
    ensure that the OpenSHMEM interfaces are not invoked concurrently by
    multiple threads.

SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE
    The OpenSHMEM program may be multithreaded and any thread may invoke the
    OpenSHMEM interfaces.

The following semantics apply to the usage of these models:

    In the SHMEM_THREAD_FUNNELED, SHMEM_THREAD_SERIALIZED, and
    SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE thread levels, the shmem_init and
    shmem_finalize calls must be invoked by the same thread.

    Any OpenSHMEM operation initiated by a thread is considered an action
    of the PE as a whole. The symmetric heap and symmetric variables scope
    are not impacted by multiple threads invoking the OpenSHMEM interfaces.
    Each PE has a single symmetric data segment and symmetric heap that is
    shared by all threads within that PE.  For example, a thread invoking
    a memory allocation routine such as shmem_malloc allocates memory that
    is accessible by all threads of the PE. The requirement that the same
    symmetric heap operations must be executed by all PEs in the same order
    also applies in a threaded environment. Similarly, the completion of
    collective operations is not impacted by multiple threads. For example,
    shmem_barrier_all is completed when all PEs enter and exit the
    shmem_barrier_all call, even though only one thread in the PE is
    participating in the collective call.

    Blocking OpenSHMEM calls will only block the calling thread, allowing
    other threads, if available, to continue executing. The calling thread
    will be blocked until the event on which it is waiting occurs. Once the
    blocking call is completed, the thread is ready to continue execution.
    A blocked thread will not prevent progress of other threads on the same
    PE and will not prevent them from executing other OpenSHMEM calls when
    the thread level permits. In addition, a blocked thread will not
    prevent the progress of OpenSHMEM calls performed on other PEs.

    In the SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE thread level, all OpenSHMEM calls are
    thread-safe. Any two concurrently running threads may make OpenSHMEM
    calls and the outcome will be as if the calls executed in some order,
    even if their execution is interleaved.

    In the SHMEM_THREAD_SERIALIZED and SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE thread levels,
    if multiple threads call collective routines, including the symmetric
    heap management routines, it is the programmer&#39;s responsibility to
    ensure the correct ordering of collective calls.</code></pre>
<h1 id="cray-specific-thread-hot-multithreading-features">Cray-specific Thread-hot Multithreading Features</h1>
<pre><code>Cray supports optimized thread-hot features with each thread allowed to
register a separate resource using Cray-specific thread-hot routines like
shmemx_thread_register(3) and shmemx_thread_unregister(3).</code></pre>
<h1 id="interaction-between-cray-thread-hot-and-openshmem-communication-context">Interaction between Cray Thread-hot and OpenSHMEM Communication Context</h1>
<pre><code>From Cray OpenSHMEMX version 8.0.1, Cray thread-hot and OpenSHMEM
communication context features can be used together.

Users are requested to understand the following option while using
multithreading support in Cray OpenSHMEMX:

On Default build using Cray OpenSHMEMX with SMP-DMAPP transport layer:

o  If known, set SHMEM_MAX_CTX to the required maximum contexts per PE

On Pre-CLE-06-UP04 builds using Cray OpenSHMEMX with SMP-DMAPP transport
layer:

o  If known, set SHMEM_MAX_NUM_THREADS to the required maximum number of
threads per process that will make Cray OpenSHMEMX calls</code></pre>
