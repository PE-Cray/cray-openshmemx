## Description
OpenSHMEM is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) library interface specification, 
which is the culmination of a standardization effort among many implementers and users 
of SHMEM programming model. SHMEM has a long history as a parallel programming model. 
It is extensively used since 1993, starting from Cray T3D systems. For the past two 
decades SHMEM library implementation in Cray systems evolved through different 
generations. The current generation of the SHMEM implementation for Cray XC and XK 
systems is called Cray SHMEM. Cray SHMEM is a proprietary SHMEM implementation from 
Cray Inc., which is OpenSHMEM standards compliant. 

The next evolution of OpenSHMEM implementation for current and future generation Cray 
systems is called Cray OpenSHMEMX.

This repository contains public announcement information about Cray OpenSHMEMX
software stack including topics like release information, performance optimization
and tuning parameters, supported environments and systems, and general backward
compatibility details.
