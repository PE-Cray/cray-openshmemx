## Description
<p align="justify">
OpenSHMEM is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) library interface specification,
which is the culmination of a standardization effort among many implementers and users
of SHMEM programming model. SHMEM has a long history as a parallel programming model.
It is extensively used since 1993, starting from Cray T3D systems. For the past two
decades SHMEM library implementation in Cray systems evolved through different
generations. The current generation of the SHMEM implementation for Cray XC and XK
systems is called Cray SHMEM. Cray SHMEM is a proprietary SHMEM implementation from
Cray Inc., which is OpenSHMEM standards compliant.
