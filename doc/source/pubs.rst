Publications
============

The Team behind the Cray OpenSHMEMX software stack were involved in multiple
research publication improving the usability and performance of OpenSHMEM
programming model. Some of the features which are discussed as part of these
works are available as part of the Cray OpenSHMEMX software stack. The 
following are the list of those publications in reverse chronological order.
